Digital Mental Health and Psychological Support System for Students in Higher Education
About the Project
This project is a proposed solution for 
Problem Statement ID 01 under the Health Care theme of the NexGen Hack hackathon (September 4-6, 2025). It aims to address the mental health challenges faced by students in higher education by creating a comprehensive and confidential digital support system.

The Problem
Mental health issues among students are a growing concern. Many students may not have access to or feel comfortable with traditional mental health services. This system seeks to provide an accessible, multi-faceted platform that offers immediate support, valuable resources, and connection to professional and peer networks.
________________________________________
Key Features
The proposed system will be a web-based and/or mobile application with the following core functionalities:
•	AI-guided First-Aid Support: An interactive chat box designed to offer coping strategies and guide students toward professional help when necessary.
•	Confidential Booking System: A secure and confidential appointment system for students to book sessions with on-campus counselors or access a mental health helpline.
•	Psychoeducational Resource Hub: A centralized library of mental wellness guides, relaxation audio, and videos available in various languages.
•	Peer Support Platform: A moderated forum that enables peer-to-peer support with the assistance of trained student volunteers.
•	Admin Dashboard: A dashboard with anonymous data analytics to help authorities recognize mental health trends and plan targeted interventions.

Proposed Architecture
The application will consist of a 
frontend built for both web and mobile platforms to ensure wide accessibility. The 
backend will manage user data securely, support the booking system, and power the AI chatbot. A database will store information related to appointments, resources, and anonymous analytics. The AI model will be a key component, providing conversational first-aid support.
